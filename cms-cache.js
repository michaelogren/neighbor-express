This will allow us to design forms tailored to your needs. Simply by editing the text fields in Airtable, we can update most of the website’s text fields and form request fields.\n2. **Steward:** For sustained management of the back office platform, we ask partners to identify a steward of the program. Is Neighbor Express something you want to lead within the city or have a third-party organization lead? Airtable offers multiple levels of permissions for viewing and editing to support this. We’ll update this section once you have decided how to staff your team and what levels of access you want to provide to each partner.\n3. **Technology Subscription(s)**: The only costs associated with Neighbor Express stem from the tool subscriptions we strongly recommend. The estimated cost for a monthly subscription to Airtable is $20. We will configure the back-office data management platform for you and then support your team as they transition to manage it.\n\n## **When adopting Neighbor Express for our community, who is responsible for what component in the full implementation model? **\n### **NEx Team: **\n\n- We’ll launch a **public-facing website** and **back office** in full. We will then transition the working site to your team and provide instructions on how to adapt content and manage the volunteer system via Airtable. \n\n### **Government Partner:**\n\n- Long-term management of the back office data platform to be used for collecting form responses as well as matching volunteers and assistance requests \n- Contact information for a program steward to field questions from community members\n- Subscription of associated technology\n\n## **How are payments processed?  **\nCities who are currently using Neighbor Express have used the following options: \n\n1. **Call the store in advance.** If the Neighbor Express program in your area partners with specific grocery stores, the homebound individual has the ability to place an order and pay over the phone in advance. \n2. **Reimburse you after you pick up their items. **The recipient pays you back via a digital payment app (Venmo, PayPal, etc). If the recipient doesn’t want to use one of those apps, or can’t, etc, they can also make out a check to _you_ after you know the order total, and leave it for you to collect at their door once you’ve (safely!) delivered their groceries. \n\nWe are constantly seeing iterations of solutions to this and will continue updating as more governments come onboard. In case of a problem, some cities have received donations which they can use as emergency funds to repay volunteers in the event payment falls through. \n\n\n## **What systems are in place to protect the data that is inputted when a request is made on the online portal? **\nWe suggest limiting the information you gather to data that is publicly available and absolutely required. Our templates include name, email, address, and phone number and specifically do not ask for payment information or sensitive records/IDs. This minimizes the risk that sensitive data could be accidentally disclosed. Furthermore, Airtable offers multiple levels of permissions for viewing and editing. We’ll update this section with further suggestions on how to staff your team and what levels of access you can provide.\n\n## **Is there a process for vetting volunteers? If so, what is it?**\nWe recommend that your team consider the specific risk in your community and design your own process for validating volunteers. By default, the Neighbor Express system includes the ability to mark and filter volunteers as High Trust, Trust, Low Trust, and not yet vetted. In order to make this determination, we utilize criteria that is provided by our government partner. If you have other ideas for features or ways we can use technology to mitigate risk and likelihood of scams, please let us know. For example, we are using the social profile of a potential volunteer and past volunteer records to determine trustworthiness in a city in California. \n\nWe have also seen other jurisdictions partner with a community based partner to enable them to start using Neighbor Express right away with a pre-vetted list of volunteers. Their volunteer sign-up form continues to collect new volunteers, and they are partnering with Sterling to complete background checks. \n",

You will need to provide your name, phone number, email, and relationship to the person, and the program will communicate with you directly to arrange the deliveries.\n\n## **Can I receive deliveries if I have special requirements and needs?**\nWhen filling out the online form, list any special requirements or health needs the program should take into consideration. Volunteers can't guarantee meeting all of them, but will do their best if they can.\n\n  [1]: https://neighborexpress.org/\n",

To protect the health of those receiving deliveries, we ask that you confirm you meet ALL of the following requirements\n\n1. You are not currently exhibiting any symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, fever, etc.) \n2. You have not visited a known COVID-19 hotspot or traveled internationally in the last 14 days. \n3. You have not come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 in at least the past 14 days.\n4. You have been practicing proper social distancing guidelines (staying 6 feet apart, not gathering in groups, avoiding mass gatherings, etc.) \nIf you don’t match these requirements but would like to help, consider making a donation or find a similar program in your area.\n\n## What is the vetting process for volunteers?\nAll local programs are concerned about the safety of their clients and use different processes to vet volunteers. Programs might assign different tasks to volunteers depending upon your availability, experience, and the outcome of the vetting process.\n\n## Amid the current COVID-19 crisis, will the organization give masks, gloves and alcohol wipes to volunteers or should I bring my own?\nAsk administrators of your local program about their specific safety practices for COVID-19, but also comply with the social distancing rules enforced in your community. For additional guidance for protective measures for volunteers of mutual aid projects servicing your community, review this [compilation of resources][1].\n\n## Who pays for the deliveries?\nWe suggest a $50 cap on grocery lists and volunteers do not have to guarantee specific brands but should have enough money to purchase the items for the clients. If an individual is requesting prepared meals be picked up from an organization like Meals on Wheels then they are not required to pay.\n\n## **How quickly should I make the delivery?**\nPlease consult with program administrators regarding the desired delivery window period. If you will not be able to complete the delivery in that time, please let them know as soon as possible so we can reassign the delivery to another volunteer.\n\n## **How often am I required to volunteer?**\nYour volunteer assignment is based on your availability, experience, and the needs of your neighbors. We welcome volunteers of all types - from those who can volunteer only once or twice to those who can commit to multiple deliveries per week.\n\n## **How long does it take to volunteer?**\nLocal programs typically arrange volunteer assignments based on your availability and experience as well as the client’s requests. So, the length of time to complete routes varies. Hours of operation and average volunteer shifts will vary so consult program administrators for clarity. It might take two hours for the entire delivery or less.\n\n## **Can I make multiple deliveries at once?**\nWe will try to arrange volunteer assignments based on your neighbors’ requests and your availability. \n\n## **Can I reschedule if something comes up?**\nAdvanced notice is preferred. Once you find out that you need a schedule change, contact your local program coordinators as soon as possible to manage your volunteer schedule.\n\n  [1]: https://mutualaiddisasterrelief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-SupplyDistro-MASafetyPracticesZine-WEB.pdf\n",

Practicing **social distancing** -- staying indoors, avoiding crowds, staying 6 feet away from other people while outside.\n\n## Delivery Protocol\n\nVolunteers will make as minimal contact with the recipient as possible upon delivery.\n\n- Volunteers should place items at the front door and text/call the requestor (or if need be, ring the doorbell) to let them know the delivery is complete. You will not enter the home of a recipient.\n- If requestors have not paid for the item in advance, you are encouraged to reimburse volunteers via a digital payment solution (e.g., Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, Square Cash).\n- If digital payment is not an option, requestors are instructed to leave an envelope with cash or a check at the door just prior to the delivery.\n\n\n**_Thank you to Invisible Hands for these guidelines._**\n\n  [1]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html\n  [2]: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html\n",
