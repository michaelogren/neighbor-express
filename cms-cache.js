This can include (but is not limited to) people over the age of 60 and those with health conditions that put them at  higher risk for COVID-19, regardless of age or ability.\n\n### **How do I sign up?**\nIf you need deliveries of essential items, fill out a form at the [Neighbor Express website][1] by first selecting your community.\n\n### **How quickly can I expect a delivery?**\nAfter filling out the online request form for groceries or non-food essentials, it can take a couple of days to get paired with a volunteer and schedule a delivery but we will keep you informed throughout the process.\n\n### **Can I sign up another person to receive this service?**\nFilling out forms on behalf of someone else is allowed, especially if you’re a relative, a caregiver or someone else familiar with and in the position to assist the client. You will need to provide your name, phone number, email, and relationship to the person, and the program will communicate with you directly to arrange the deliveries.\n\n### **Can I receive deliveries if I have special requirements and needs?**\nWhen filling out the online form, list any special requirements or health needs the program should take into consideration. Volunteers can't guarantee meeting all of them, but will do their best if they can.\n\n### **Is there a maximum amount - cost or number of items - I can request on my grocery list?**\nThere is a suggested $50 price cap, so specify item types but not brand/store. Volunteers are sourcing groceries for many neighbors and cannot guarantee specific brands. \n\n### **How do I pay for deliveries?**\nNeighbor volunteers will drop off the groceries at your door and, if payment is needed, you can safely give them a check/cash/digital reimbursement. But if you’re requesting prepared meals picked up from an organization like Meals on Wheels then you are not required to pay.\n\n  [1]: https://neighborexpress.org/\n",

            "body_en": "### **What health requirements do I have to meet in order to volunteer?**\nHealthy community members can sign up to volunteer to make deliveries. To protect the health of those receiving deliveries, we ask that you confirm you meet ALL of the following requirements\n\n1. You are not currently exhibiting any [symptoms of COVID-19][1] (cough, fever, etc.)\n2. You have not visited a known COVID-19 hotspot or traveled internationally in the last 14 days. \n3. You have not come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 in at least the past 14 days.\n4. You have been practicing proper [social distancing guidelines][2] (staying 6 feet apart, not gathering in groups, avoiding mass gatherings, etc.) \n\nIf you don’t match these requirements but would like to help, consider making a donation or find a similar program (like [Meals on Wheels][3]) in your area.\n\n### **Can minors volunteer? What’s the age limit to volunteer?**\nVarious volunteer opportunities often require a minimum age of 18, so consult with the program administrator for their requirements. Healthy community members can sign up to volunteer to make deliveries. Also, if you can’t volunteer but would like to help, consider donating to help and finding [another similar program][3] within your area.\n\n### **How often am I required to volunteer?**\nYour volunteer assignment is based on your availability, experience, and the needs of our neighbors and the requirements of your program. \n\n### **Do I need a car?**\nA car is not necessary in order to volunteer. Generally, volunteers drive their own vehicles to make deliveries. But in some communities, such as large cities, volunteers might walk or use mass transit. Ask administrators of your local program about transportation when setting up volunteer assignments.\n\n### **How long does it take to volunteer?**\nLocal programs typically arrange volunteer assignments based on your availability and experience as well as the client’s requests. So, the length of time to complete routes varies. Hours of operation and average volunteer shifts will vary so consult program administrators for clarity. It might take two hours for the entire delivery or less.\n\n### **Can I reschedule if something comes up?**\nAdvanced notice is preferred. Once you find out that you need a schedule change, contact your local program as soon as possible to manage your volunteer schedule.\n\n### **Who pays for the deliveries?**\nThere is a price cap for groceries set by each locality, so volunteers do not have to guarantee specific brands but should have enough money to purchase the items for the clients.  [IF RELEVANT] If they’re requesting prepared meals picked up from an organization like Meals on Wheels then they are not required to pay.\n\n### **Are individuals who request a grocery delivery aware that they have to pay for the items?**\nYes, they are told in different ways that they were expected to pay for groceries upon delivery. There is a price cap for groceries set by each local program, so volunteers do not have to guarantee specific brands. [IF RELEVANT] But if they’re requesting prepared meals picked up from an organization like Meals on Wheels then they are not required to pay. After you drop off the groceries at their door, if payment is needed, you can safely collect a check/cash/digital reimbursement.\n\n### **Can I make multiple deliveries at once?**\nWe will try to arrange volunteer assignments based on your neighbors’ requests and your availability. Consult with the program administrator when setting your route.\n\n### **What is the vetting process for volunteers?**\nAll local programs are concerned about the safety of their clients and use different processes to vet volunteers. Programs might assign different tasks to volunteers depending upon your availability, experience, and the outcome of the vetting process.\n\n### **Amid the current COVID-19 crisis, will the organization give masks, gloves and alcohol wipes to volunteers or should I bring my own? **\nAsk administrators of your local program about their specific safety practices for COVID-19, but also comply with the social distancing rules enforced in your community.
